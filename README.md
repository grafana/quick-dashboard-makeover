## Acknowledgments

This repo is a fork of the Extreme Dashboard Makeover developed by the Field Engineering team at Grafana Labs. It simplifies the workflow to import them as it relies only on a fake data generator (no need to have access to the data sources). But it makes sacrifice on the "Library panel" exercise as the distribution is made differently.

Some useful ressources from Grafana Labs and friends:

* [On demand videos and webinars](https://grafana.com/videos/)
* [Docs for LGTM, k6, OnCall, etc.](https://grafana.com/docs/)
* [Next Grafana Labs events](https://grafana.com/about/events/)
